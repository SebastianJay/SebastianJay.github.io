      Hello and welcome! My name's Jay. I'm a software engineer interested in gaming, web and
      mobile development, image processing, build/deploy automation, and CS pedagogy &mdash;
      this list will likely grow longer as I learn more. <span class="fa fa-smile-o"></span>
      </p>
      <p>
      This site illustrates several projects I've worked on for classes, clubs,
      and just for fun. In some cases, portfolio items will be accompanied with
      builds that you can interact with through the site. These links are
      provided at the bottom of the page (please note that the builds are intended
      for desktop clients).
      </p>
      <p>
      I've generated this site's webpages with a very basic templating system which
      interpolates YAML (for the portfolio) and Markdown (for the CV) into HTML
      snippets using short Python scripts. You are welcome to adapt this system
      for your own purposes: <a href="https://github.com/SebastianJay/SebastianJay.github.io"
      target="_blank">check out the repo.</a> The front-end stack is Bootstrap 4
      + jQuery + Font Awesome.
