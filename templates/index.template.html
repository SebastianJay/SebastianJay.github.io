      Hello and welcome! My name's Jay. I'm a software engineer interested
      in gaming, web development, image processing, and automation (and,
      admittedly, anything else that sounds fun).
      </p>
      <p>
      This site illustrates several projects I've worked on for classes, clubs,
      and just for fun. In some cases, portfolio items will be accompanied with
      builds that you can interact with through the site. These links are
      provided below.
      </p>
      <p>
      I've created this site itself with a very basic templating system which
      interpolates YAML data (or, in the case of the CV, Markdown) into HTML
      snippets using simple Python scripts. You are welcome to adapt this system
      for your own purposes. <a href="https://github.com/SebastianJay/SebastianJay.github.io"
