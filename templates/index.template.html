      Hello and welcome! My name's Jay, and I'm a software engineer interested
      in gaming, web development, image processing, automation, and admittedly
      anything else that sounds interesting.

      This site illustrates several projects I've worked on for classes, clubs,
      and just for fun. In some cases, portfolio items will be accompanied with
      builds that you can interact with through the site. These links are
      provided below for your convenience.
