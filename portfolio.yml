    title:        Wilderness
    subtitle:     Minimalist Text-Based Adventure
    description:  "Built with a custom Python engine (only using external libraries tkinter for graphics and pygame for music) and markup language, this game tells the story of two individuals who are traveling to a sinkhole that threatens to consume their planet. Travel between towns, collect items, and solve puzzles to keep the plot moving."

    subtitle:     2-Player Local Coop Platformer
    description:  "This game was made for a UVA game design course and built with a homemade TypeScript game engine which targets HTML5 canvas. Two players control a red and a blue character on a horizontally split screen; the characters have special interactions with objects of their color. To progress through the level, players need to switch places with each other: communication is key!"

    subtitle:     Portfolio on the LAMP stack
    description:  "As the Student Game Developers' webmaster, I inherited a website with many static HTML pages; this wasn't convenient for maintenance purposes. We had access to the LAMP stack, so I added a DB schema and server side code, such that adding new content is as simple as inserting new rows. <em>NOTE</em>: I don't claim credit for the front-end work (which originates from a Bootstrap 3 theme)."

    subtitle:     Autonomous Chessboard
    description:  "For the UVA computer engineering capstone, we created a system that allowed humans to play over-the-board chess against computers. The system is composed of a Reed switch circuit to detect human piece movements, a connection to a Stockfish chess engine to devise responses, and a motor-driven actuating magnet to execute those responses."
