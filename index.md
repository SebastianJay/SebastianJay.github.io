A hosting place for my projects! **NOTE**: Please do not view the projects made with Unity (Bounce, Yeah Music) on Chrome, since it has dropped support for NPAPI.

* [Bounce](Bounce/bounce_web.html), a 2D platformer of epic proportions
	* Controls are specified during gameplay in the top-right corner of the screen.
	* Project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/SebastianJay/Bounce-Game)

* [CubeWorld](CubeWorld/cube_main.html), a WebGL-based 3D platformer demo made for my graphics class
	* Controls are arrow keys for movement, Page Up/Down for looking up and down, and Space for jump. Or, if the game canvas doesn't fit on your screen, use WASD for movement, Q/E for looking up and down, and P for jump.
	* Goal is to collect all the spheres. Get a sphere by touching it, run and jump toward a side of the cube to switch gravities, and avoid obstacles like fire and bottomless pits.
	* Project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/SebastianJay/CubeWorld)

* [Yeah Music](YeahMusic/Web.html), a musical infinite jumping game
	* Press Return or click the Start button to begin.
	* Use side arrow keys to move, up arrow key to jump.
	* Hit the platforms with different colors to get different musical tracks!
	* Project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/josephbaik/uva.hax0rs)

* [Neural Style Music Visualizer](MusicVisual/index.html), a WebGL (Pixi.js) visualizer for music
	* Control the output video/audio with the dropdowns and sliders.
	* Watch the video transition between two different artistic styles for the same background as the song changes between treble and bass; also see the particle systems corresponding to the strength of the song's tones.
	* This prototype is limited in functionality, but it could be extended with server-side scripting to have more interaction with the user (i.e. allow user-uploaded audio, backgrounds, styles).
	* Project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/SebastianJay/NeuralStyle-Music)

* Machine Vision Project - Chess Logger
	* Generates a log of chess moves from a video stream of a chess game, with occasional user input.
	* Uses NI Vision Assistant for image processing and LabVIEW for setting up image acquisition as well as logic for the logging application.
	* [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEiwm47Tykk) - shows setup and part of a game, making use of a USB webcam looking down on custom cut pieces.
	* Project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/SebastianJay/Chess-Logger)

* Embedded Systems Project - Cyclone Game
	* Modeled after the cyclone redemption game found in many arcades (i.e. try to stop the spinning light).
	* Targets the MSP430 by Texas Instruments, and uses three different header boards designed by UVA (flash memory, 7-segment displays and rotary encoder, and circular array of LEDs).
	* [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDDrdj2gOZ8) - shows off how the game is played.

* Signals and Systems Project - Electrocardiogram
	* A printed circuit board designed to take in small electrical signals from one's heart and send them to the NI MyRIO for digital processing.
	* [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IDlTAr23Gs) - shows connections from human arms to the PCB to the MyRIO to a laptop, which displays the heartbeat trace.

* Electronics Project - Music Visualizer
	* Similar to the neural style visualizer, but now implemented in hardware. The circuit board takes in an audio signal and lights up two different LEDs corresponding to treble and bass frequencies.
	* [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUGfNYyqKtA) - shows the circuit board in action with Darude Sandstorm!
