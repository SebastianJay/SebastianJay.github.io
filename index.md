A hosting place for my projects! **NOTE**: Please do not view the projects made with Unity (Bounce, Yeah Music) on Chrome, since it has dropped support for NPAPI.

* [Bounce](Bounce/bounce_web.html), a "precision platformer" of epic proportions
	* Controls are specified during gameplay in the top-right corner of the screen
	* Project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/SebastianJay/Bounce-Game)

* [CubeWorld](CubeWorld/cube_main.html), a WebGL-based 3D platformer demo made for my graphics class
	* Controls are arrow keys for movement, Page Up/Down for looking up and down, and Space for jump. Or, if the game canvas doesn't fit on your screen, use WASD for movement, Q/E for looking up and down, and P for jump.
	* Goal is to collect all the spheres. Get a sphere by touching it, run and jump toward a side of the cube to switch gravities, and avoid obstacles like fire and bottomless pits.
	* Project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/SebastianJay/CubeWorld)

* [Yeah Music](YeahMusic/Web.html), a musical infinite jumping game
	* Press Return or click the Start button to begin.
	* Use side arrow keys to move, up arrow key to jump
	* Hit the platforms with different colors to get different musical tracks!
